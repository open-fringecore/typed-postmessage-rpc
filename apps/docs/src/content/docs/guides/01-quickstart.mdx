import { Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import helloServiceSource from '../../../source-code/hello-service.mts?raw';
import basicWorkerSource from '../../../source-code/basic-worker.mts?raw';
import basicIndexSource from '../../../source-code/basic-index.mts?raw';
import basicClientSource from '../../../source-code/basic-client.mts?raw';
import basicInvokeSource from '../../../source-code/basic-invoke.mts?raw';

Let's get up and running with using `typed-postmessage-rpc` to start a server inside a worker, and 
access its services from the main script.

## Assumptions

1. We are assuming you are using frontend tooling similar to [vite](https://vitejs.dev/), hence when we show something too vite-specific; do adapt it to your tooling of choice.
2. We are assuming you're using TypeScript (duhh).

## Installation

Let's start by installing the package.

```bash
pnpm install --save-exact typed-postmessage-rpc
```

## Define a Service

Here we are defining a service endearingly named `helloService` that has a function called `hello` that
takes a name as the first argument and returns the string `Hello {name}!`

<Code code={helloServiceSource} lang="typescript" title="service.mts" />

## Define a Worker

It really is that simple.

<Code code={basicWorkerSource} lang="typescript" title="worker.mts" />

## Start Worker

<Code code={basicIndexSource} lang="typescript" title="index.mts" />

## Connect Client

<Code code={basicClientSource} lang="typescript" title="index.mts" ins={"{2, 8-10}"}/>

## Invoke `hello(name: string)`

<Code code={basicInvokeSource} lang="typescript" title="index.mts" ins={"{12}"} mark={"{14}"} />

## Done

You should be seeing the following on your console:

```
Hello RPC!
```

## Next Steps

The cool thing is, the opposite would also work. You could very-well serve a service on the main script,
and then connect to it from a client running inside the worker. Check out the [Web Workers](/contexts/workers) section for more.

This was an example using workers, but feel free to explore [iFrames](/contexts/iframes/),
[windows](/contexts/windows/) or [shared workers](/contexts/shared-workers/) next.
